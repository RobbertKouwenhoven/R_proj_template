# The CES R project template

This is a github template for a CES R project repository. This template can
be loaded when creating a new project in github. As such you pre-populate a
project with a standard set of directories. This ensures a project-oriented 
and consistent workflow across all lab members, and removes some of the mental
overhead in making decisions on a project structure.

## Use

### A github project from the template

To use the template create a new repository on github, as you otherwise would.

Name your repository!
![](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/environmental_data_science_101/raw/main/images/new_repo_2.png)

However, be careful to select the correct owner of the project
if you have multiple identities.

### Clone to your local computer

The new repository will be created and populated with the files of the template.
You can then clone the project to your local computer to add files.

Although optional it is wise to rename the `*.Proj` file as this will not
automatically change to your repository name. However, retaining the original
name should not change any of the functionality.
